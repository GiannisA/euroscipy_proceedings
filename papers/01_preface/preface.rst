The conference
--------------

EuroSciPy, the *European Conference on Python in Science*, reached in
2013 its 6th edition. The 7th is under preparation in Cambridge, UK.
The conference gathers about 200 scientists from all over Europe and combines
tutorials and scientific presentations.

The tutorials were held in two parallel sessions, allowing the newcomers to get
acquainted with the basic but powerful components of the *SciPy stack*
[SPstack]_ and experienced users to master advanced techniques or tools.

The topics for the talks and posters were very diverse: pure mathematics,
analysis of social networks, earth sciences, etc.

We had for 2013 two very unusual contributions that, in our mind, reflect the
conference's connection to a lively and evolving community: Ian Ozsvald's *How
to build an open-sourced Data Science Company* reflects the current trend in
academia to look into alternative career paths and Mike MÃ¼ller's panel
discussion *Making programmers* recalls the attention given to the education of
programming in scientific curricula.

The proceedings
---------------

2013 marks the first edition of the proceedings for the European Conference on
Python in Science.
Apart from bringing an added value to the conference contributors, a motivation
to edit these proceedings is to provide an academic venue for scientists that
use Python for computing, whereas *traditional publishing* fails to adapt to
this fact [ORC]_.

The reviewing model for EuroSciPy follows the one of the US-based SciPy
conference [SPprocs]_.
Contributors prepare their manuscript as reStructuredText and submit it, as a
`Pull Request` (PR), via the online code hosting provider GitHub.
Reviewers then discuss the manuscripts openly on the PR page until it is ready
for acceptance.

The main reference for these proceedings is hosted on the arXiv.org preprint
server [arXiv]_ and the arXiv identifier [arXivID]_ is considered a part of the
citation record for the proceedings.

While the publication of associated open-source software is not mandatory for
the participation in the proceedings, it is encouraged by the program committee
and most contributions provide at least a publicly accessible source code.
To help the reader, a note has been added below each abstract that states the
availability of the code.

We hope that these proceedings will find a good place in the SciPy literature
and we would like to address our gratitude to the referees that made their
publication possible.
